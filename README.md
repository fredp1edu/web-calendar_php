# web-calendar_php
A quickie web calendar done with PHP/MySQL/JQuery to be redone later with Node
This calendar app was adapted from a book, Pro PHP and JQuery, I was reading to catch up on PHP skills. I chose PHP as the platform because while it is old and a bit cumbersome writing, it is used by a vast majority of web hosts in the US and, as such, I have a few projects I'm working on for a few organizations, and thus need to get my practice in.
I will reproduce the calendar project as it is in the book, with some tweaking (using mysqli instead of PDO, which didn't work for me for some reason), but there are other places I will go back and reconfigure altogether. The sample in the book relies heavily on one class to do just about all the work, including producing the HTML for various forms and the calendar structure itself. I would distribute that work out more among various helper classes and the php output files themselves. I also don't like having to go to a refresh screen for each activity as is required by PHP, and move a lot of the items to the front end and let JQuery/JSON handle it more seamlessly. I will also lesson the number of hits and queries to the db.  Yeah, a lot of changes need to be made to the layout.
